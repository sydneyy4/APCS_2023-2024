//variable intiger "n" declared by 'int n = 5;'
//String s = 'Hello, world!'
//String s holds memory & is reference to class String w/ the actual object ("Hello, world!")
//each letter of String s ("Hello, world!") is separate (start counting them from 0 like an array)
//if only want "Hello" (first 5 letters), you start at 0 & end at one # past the # of last letter --> s.substring(0,5)
//stating only one # prints the letters starting from that number until end of string --> s.substring(7) ---> 'world!'
